            <p>The IUCN Red List tracks the number of described species and updates this figure annually based on the latest work of taxonomists. In 2022, it listed 2.16 million species on the planet. In the chart, we see the breakdown across a range of taxonomic groups - 1.05 million insects, over 11,000 birds, over 11,000 reptiles, and over 6,000 mammals.</p>

            <h3>RESULT</h3>
            <p>To combat the climate crisis and secure a safe future below 1.5¬∞C, the world needs to cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gasses by 50 per cent within the decade.
             <br>
              For many, ambitious targets such as this can induce a sense of dread and paralysis. But experts say there is a lot we can do as individuals to counter climate change.
              
              Research shows that lifestyle changes could help the planet slash emissions by up to 70 per cent by 2050.
              <br>
              We sat down with Garrette Clark, an expert in sustainable living with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), to learn more about what people and policymakers can do to make sustainable choices to help secure a healthier planet.  </p>

The tropical rainforests of Africa, for example, were the habitat in which the ancestors of humans evolved and are where our nearest surviving relatives‚Äîchimpanzees and gorillas‚Äîlive still.</p>

     <p>The same ‚Äúwinter-wonderland‚Äù conditions which make Jackson Hole a mecca for winter recreation can prove challenging for our valley‚Äôs wildlife. While Jackson‚Äôs wildlife is adapted to our mountainous climate, deep snowpack and lack of available food still make surviving winter a constant challenge for many species.

      Unintentional human disturbance, such as backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, or even off-leashed dogs in critical wintering areas can increase stress at a critical time of year and force animals to burn precious calories needed for survival.</p>
     <p>Seasonal wildlife closures zones in Bridger-Teton National Forest and in Grand Teton National Park address this issue by helping to provide safe havens of critical habitat for species, such as elk, mule deer, and bighorn sheep.

      The Jackson Hole region provides boundless front and back country recreational opportunities. Being Wild Jackson Hole kindly reminds visitors that part of ‚Äúknowing before you go‚Äù is understanding where these limited closures exist.
      
      Respecting wildlife winter closures is one important step to take to ensure our cherished wildlife can conserve enough energy to survive until spring.</p>
